General Linux scripts for everyday use

Supported operating systems (currently): Ubuntu, Debian (BETA), CentOS/RHEL, Fedora, Oracle Linux, OpenSUSE, Amazon Linux AMI

#### flightcheck.sh:

Installs basic packages for server operating systems and updates software currently installed. Good after a fresh install to make sure everything is running smoothly and is up to date.

#### hydration.sh

Meant to be a script to install basic programs for applications, such as Apache, MySQL, Varnish, etc. Forked into hydrationv2.sh and will eventually be merged.

#### hydrationv2.sh

Multi-installer script to install applications such as Apache, MySQL, etc. Forked from hydration.sh

#### ssl-extract.sh

Extracts a PKCS12 certificate and key from a PKCS file

#### ssl-generate.sh

Generates a CSR and key for a website, after that the only thing left to do is install the certificate
